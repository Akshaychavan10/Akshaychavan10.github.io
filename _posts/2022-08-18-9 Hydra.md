list of files that can contain hashed passwords:

| **`Windows`** | **`Linux`** |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| unattend.xml  | shadow      |
| sysprep.inf   | shadow.bak  |
| SAM           | password    |
The following topics will be discussed:

- Brute forcing basic HTTP auth
- Brute force for default passwords
- Brute forcing login forms
- Brute force usernames
- Creating personalized username and password wordlists based on our target
- Brute forcing service logins, such as FTP and SSH

| **Password Attack Type** |
| ------------------------ |
| `Dictionary attack`      |
| `Brute force`            |
| `Traffic interception`   |
| `Man In the Middle`      |
| `Key Logging`            |
| `Social engineering`     |

#### Brute Force vs Dictionary Attacks

in brute force the attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.For example, if we specify the password's length as `4`, it would test all keys from `aaaa` to `zzzz`, literally `brute forcing` all characters to find a working password.

A `Dictionary Attack` tries to guess passwords with the help of lists.

**Methods of Brute Force Attacks** 

|**Attack**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|Online Brute Force Attack|Attacking a live application over the network, like HTTP, HTTPs, SSH, FTP, and others|
|Offline Brute Force Attack|Also known as Offline Password Cracking, where you attempt to crack a hash of an encrypted password.|
|Reverse Brute Force Attack|Also known as username brute-forcing, where you try a single common password with a list of usernames on a certain service.|
|Hybrid Brute Force Attack|Attacking a user by creating a customized password wordlist, built using known intelligence about the user or the service.|

 ## Hydra
1. Start with default username password list pair.

`hydra -c /wordlist <ip> -s <port_number> Request_method Target_path`
Example : `hydra -c /opt/seclist/wordlist_passwords 194.21.34.33 -s 8080 http-get /login.php`

**Username Bruteforce**

```bash
hydra -L /opt/wordlist/username.txt -p amormio_pass -u -f 178.34.59.134 -s 8080 http-get /
```

`-L` : Username wordlist
-P : password wordlist


#### Determine login parameters

we can find out login parameter using `inspect element` or `burp`.

Example :

```bash
```bash
"/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=<form name='login'"
```
