**HUD Heads Up Display** 

allow us to control most of the main features from right within the pre-configured browsers. we can enable HUD by clicking its button at the end of the top bar.

**Step and Continue** 

We can choose to `step` to send the request and examine its response and break any further requests.
The `step` button is helpful when we want to examine every step of the page's functionality

we can choose to `continue` and let the page send the remaining requests.
`continue` is useful when we are only interested in a single request and can forward the remaining requests once we reach our target request.

#### Automatic Modification (Replacer)

We may want to apply certain modifications to all outgoing HTTP requests or all incoming HTTP responses in certain situations.

Here we can use zap `Replacer` (by pressing `CTRL+R` or clicking on Replaces in zap options menu)  --> click on `Add`

Modify Response body :

#### Repeating Request

Once we locate our request, we can right-click on it and select `Open/Resend with Request Editor`. It allow us to resend with the send button.
We can also see the `Method` drop-down menu, allowing us to quickly switch the request method to any other HTTP method.

#### Encoding/Decoding

we can use the `Encoder/Decoder/Hash` tool, which will automatically decode strings using various decoders in the `Decode` tab:

#### Proxying Tools

we can use [proxychains](https://github.com/haad/proxychains) which routes all traffic coming from any cmd-line tool to any proxy we specify.we can prepend `proxychains` to any command, and the traffic of that command should be routed through `proxychains`

```shell-session
cyber7ron@htb[/htb]$ proxychains curl http://SERVER_IP:PORT
```

**Nmap**

we can use proxy on nmap with inbuilt function.
```shell-session
nmap --proxies http://127.0.0.1:8080 SERVER_IP -pPORT -Pn -sC
```

**Metasploit** 

```shell-session
cyber7ron@htb[/htb]$ msfconsole

msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/http/robots_txt
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > set PROXIES HTTP:127.0.0.1:8080

PROXIES => HTTP:127.0.0.1:8080


msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > set RHOST SERVER_IP

RHOST => SERVER_IP


msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > set RPORT PORT

RPORT => PORT


msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > run

[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

#### Web Fuzzer

We can use `Zap Fuzzer` to fuzz web end-points.

Right Click-on Request --> Attack > Fuzz. this will open fuzzer window.

![payload processing](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/zap_fuzzer.jpg)

we need to configure four options
1. Fuzz location
2. Payloads
3. Processors
4. Options

**Fuzz Location** : Select parameter you want to fuzz and click on `Add` button on the right pane. 

![payload processing](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/zap_fuzzer_add.jpg)

The place with green marker selected and opened `payload` window for us to configure payloads.

**Payload** : We can click on the `Add` button to add our payloads and select from 8 different payload types.
Following are some of them :

- `File`: This allows us to select a payload wordlist from a file.
- `File Fuzzers`: This allows us to select wordlists from built-in databases of wordlists.
- `Numberzz`: Generates sequences of numbers with custom increments.

**Processors** : Perform some processing on each word in out paylaods.

List of some processors .

- Base64 Decode/Encode
- MD5 Hash
- Postfix String
- Prefix String
- SHA-1/256/512 Hash
- URL Decode/Encode
- Script

**Options** : we can set a few options for out fuzzers. like Concurrent threads per scan to 20 etc.

#### Web Scanner

ZAP Scanner is capable of building site maps using ZAP Spider and performing both passive and active scans to look for various types of vulnerabilities.

**Spider** :

- Locate any request related to site and select `Attack > Spider` from the right-click menu.

> ZAP also has a different type of Spider called `Ajax Spider`, which can be started from the third button on the right pane. The difference between this and the normal scanner is that Ajax Spider also tries to identify links requested through JavaScript AJAX requests, which may be running on the page even after it loads.

**Passive Scanner** :

As ZAP Spider runs and makes requests to various end-points, it is automatically running its passive scanner on each response to see if it can identify potential issues from the source code, like missing security headers or DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.

We can also check the `Alerts` tab on the main ZAP UI to see all identified issues.

**Active Scan** :

we can click on the `Active Scan` button on the right pane to start an active scan on all identified pages.
The Active Scanner will try various types of attacks against all identified pages and HTTP parameters to identify as many vulnerabilities as it can.

**Reporting**

We can generate repots `Report > Generate HTML Report` from the top bar.

#### Zap Marketplace

Install various types of community developed add ons.To access marketplace click on the `manage Add-ons` button and then select the `Marketplace` tab.
