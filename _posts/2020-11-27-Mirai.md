This write-up details the process of exploiting the Mirai box, a relatively simple challenge that requires default credentials for initial access and some basic forensic knowledge to find the root flag.


## Enumeration

Our journey begins with a classic enumeration technique - an nmap scan.

```nmap 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-11-28 07:51 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.48
Host is up (0.43s latency).

PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u3 (protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:

```

The scan reveals several open ports:

- 22/tcp (ssh): OpenSSH service running, potentially allowing access.
- 53/tcp (domain): DNS service most likely handled by dnsmasq.
- 80/tcp (http): Lighttpd web server running, but with no title.
- 1285/tcp (upnp): UPnP service running.
- 32400/tcp (http): Plex Media Server httpd service running, but unauthorized access.

Focusing on information gathering, Let's head to port 80, the web server. Initially, the website seems to return nothing. However, inspecting the response in Burp Suite reveals that it's actually a Pi-hole ad blocker.

Next, I used ffuf to discover any hidden directories. This uncovers an `/admin` directory, likely hosting the Pi-hole admin panel. I searched online for default Pi-hole credentials but find no success upon trying them.

## Gaining Shell

![creds](/assets/htb/mirai/creds.png)

A quick Google search on the Pi-hole GitHub repository reveals that the software uses a random password during setup. This explains why the default credentials didn't work. However, trying the same password on SSH surprisingly grants us access!

## Getting Root

Knowing the user's password, I checked if I have sudo privileges. Luckily, `sudo -i` allow me to escalate my privileges to root.

to get root flag we need some forensic knowledge which i have zero experience with. 
when we cat the root.txt it print `I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...`

so it has USB mounted on the machine. `mount` to show mounted device it show that `/dev/sdb` on `/media/usbstick.` 


Using the `mount` command, we discover a mounted device at `/dev/sdb` mapped to `/media/usbstick`. Exploring this directory, we find a file named `damit.txt`, which appears to be a note indicating James deleted the root flag.

Without proper forensic tools, we resort to a simple trick - using strings on damit.txt. This brute-force approach reveals the hidden root flag within the file.

By combining basic enumeration techniques, exploiting default credentials for SSH access, and employing a rudimentary forensic method, we successfully retrieved the root flag on the Mirai box.
