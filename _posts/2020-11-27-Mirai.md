Mirai is the easy box which have default creds to gain shell access and the sudo for root access, althrought it has some forensic challenge to find root flag.


## Enumeration

As always we start with nmap scan.

```nmap 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-11-28 07:51 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.48

looking to nmap scan we see that there is some port open my first aproach is enumerate web service for more information gathering so head on port 80.

i checked website but it does not return anything. so i fired up burp and inspect request in burp.after inspecting the response of request i find out that it host pi-hole which is used to block ad.

next step is find out if any directories. i used ffuf to fuzz directories. 

fuzz for directories got `/admin` directory which host admin panel for pi-hole

searched for default cred on google. try this cred on admin panel log in page but it does not work.

## Gaining Shell

after checking the GitHub repository I found out that pi-hole used a random password while setup so I cant use to login on admin panel. although I tried it on ssh and it works. get initial access to the system using ssh.

## Getting Root

if I know the user password first thing I check if the user can run sudo. using sudo we can run all cmd as root on the machine. get root shell using `sudo -i`

to get root flag we need some forensic knowledge which i have zero experience with. 
when we cat root.txt it show `I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...`

so it has USB mounted on the machine. `mount` to show mounted device it show that `/dev/sdb` on `/media/usbstick.` 


check /media/usbstick it has damit.txt file which is a note from James.

he deleted our root.txt . now we have to recover it.i don't have experience with forensic so we just use simple `strings` on to get root.txt.
