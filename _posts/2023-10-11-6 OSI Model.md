### Overview of the OSI model

- The OSI model is a fundamental model used in networking
- It provides a framework for how networked devices send, receive and interpret data
- It allows for different functions and designs of devices on a network to communicate with each other
**Benefits of the OSI model**
- Data sent across a network that follows the uniformity of the OSI model can be understood by other devices
**Structure of the OSI model**
- The OSI model consists of seven layers
- Each layer has a different set of responsibilities
- Data travels through each layer, and specific processes take place and pieces of information are added to the data
**Layers of the OSI model**
- The seven layers of the OSI model are arranged from Layer 7 to Layer 1

## Layers

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose in facilitating communication between devices. Let’s go through each layer along with a real-life example:

1. **Physical Layer**: This layer deals with the physical connection between devices. It defines the electrical, mechanical, and procedural aspects of the physical connection. Examples include cables, connectors, and network interface cards (NICs).
    
    *Real-life Example*: Think of physical mail delivery. The physical layer would be analogous to the roads, vehicles, and mailboxes that physically transport letters from one location to another.
    
2. **Data Link Layer**: This layer provides node-to-node communication, ensuring that data packets are delivered error-free and in sequence. It also handles issues such as flow control and error detection. Ethernet and Wi-Fi are examples of protocols operating at this layer.
    
    *Real-life Example*: In a conversation between two people, the data link layer would be akin to the language they speak and the rules they follow to ensure effective communication. Just as Ethernet ensures data packets are correctly sent between devices.
    
3. **Network Layer**: The network layer is responsible for routing packets across multiple networks, choosing the best path for data transmission. IP (Internet Protocol) operates at this layer.
    
    *Real-life Example*: Imagine sending a package through various postal services to reach its destination. The network layer would be like the postal service determining the best route for the package to travel through different cities and countries.
    
4. **Transport Layer**: This layer ensures that data is reliably delivered between endpoints and provides mechanisms for error-checking, flow control, and data segmentation. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are examples of transport layer protocols.
    
    *Real-life Example*: Consider a phone conversation. The transport layer would be similar to the conversation’s protocol, ensuring that both parties can acknowledge when they receive information and request retransmission if something gets missed.
    
5. **Session Layer**: The session layer establishes, maintains, and synchronizes communication sessions between devices. It also handles security authentication and ensures orderly termination of sessions.
    
    *Real-life Example*: When you log in to your online banking account, the session layer manages the session between your device and the bank’s server, ensuring secure communication throughout your banking session.
    
6. **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for data translation, compression, and encryption. It ensures that data exchanged between systems can be read by the receiving system. Examples include encryption protocols and data compression algorithms.
    
    *Real-life Example*: Imagine you’re reading a document in a foreign language. The presentation layer would be akin to a translator who translates the document into a language you understand.
    
7. **Application Layer**: The application layer provides an interface for user processes or applications to access network services. Examples include web browsers, email clients, and file transfer protocols (FTP).
    
    *Real-life Example*: When you use a web browser to access a website, the application layer facilitates communication between your browser and the web server, allowing you to view and interact with the website’s content.
