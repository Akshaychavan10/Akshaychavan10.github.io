## Analyze Packet Contents

We focus on three main Sections :

1. Packet list pane (top section)
2. Packet details pane (middle section)
3. packet bytes pane (bottom section)
![The captured data interface contains three main sections: the packet list pane (the top section); the packet details pane (the middle section); and the packet bytes pane (the bottom section).](/assets/img/notes/linux/details.jpg)


#### Packet List

- located at top windows, show all packet found in the active capture file.
