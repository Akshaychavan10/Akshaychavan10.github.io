## Navigation
with navigation we move across the system and work in directories and with files, we need and want.


```
pwd : present working directory
ls : list file and directory
ls -la : list all and give info
cd : change directory
cd - : jump to home directory
```

```
cry0l1t3@htb[~]$ ls -l

total 32

above columns that are structured as follows:

|**Column Content**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`drwxr-xr-x`|Type and permissions|
|`2`|Number of hard links to the file/directory|
|`cry0l1t3`|Owner of the file/directory|
|`htbacademy`|Group owner of the file/directory|
|`4096`|Size of the file or the number of blocks used to store the directory information|

## working with files and directories

#### Create, Move and Copy

```
touch : create file
mkdir : create directory
tree : show hole structure of directory in tree format
mv : move file or rename file or directory.
cp : copy file.
```

***
## Editing files

- common editor [[vi]], [[vim]], and [[nano]].

***
## Find files and Directories

#### Which
- tool returns the path to the file that should be executed.
```
cyber7ron@htb[/htb]$ which python
/usr/bin/python
```

#### Find
- find files and folder also filter the results such as size of the file or the date.
```
cyber7ron@htb[/htb]$ find <location> <options>
```

| **Option**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-type f`             | Hereby, we define the type of the searched object. In this case, '`f`' stands for '`file`'.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `-name *.conf`        | With '`-name`', we indicate the name of the file we are looking for. The asterisk (`*`) stands for 'all' files with the '`.conf`' extension.                                                                                                                                   |
| `-user root`          | This option filters all files whose owner is the root user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `-size +20k`          | We can then filter all the located files and specify that we only want to see the files that are larger than 20 KiB.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `-newermt 2020-03-03` | With this option, we set the date. Only files newer than the specified date will be presented.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `-exec ls -al {} \;`  | This option executes the specified command, using the curly brackets as placeholders for each result. The backslash escapes the next character from being interpreted by the shell because otherwise, the semicolon would terminate the command and not reach the redirection. |
| `2>/dev/null`         | This is a `STDERR` redirection to the '`null device`', which we will come back to in the next section. This redirection ensures that no errors are displayed in the terminal. This redirection must `not` be an option of the 'find' command.                                  |
- For more take look at [[find]].

#### Locate

- faster than `find` but have less filter options.
- locate works with local database that contains all info about existing file and folders.
	- we can update this database with `sudo updatedb` .
```shell-session
cyber7ron@htb[/htb]$ locate *.conf
```

## File Descriptions and Redirections

- A File Descriptor (FD) in linux os is an indicator of connection maintained by the kernel to perform I/O operations.
- In windows its called filehandle.

1. Data Stream for Input
    - `STDIN – 0`
2. Data Stream for Output
    - `STDOUT – 1`
3. Data Stream for Output that relates to an error occurring.
    - `STDERR – 2`

#### Pipes 

- Redirect STDOUT  (standard output) from one program to be processed by another.
- With pipe One of the most commonly used tool is `grep`.
	- Grep is used to filter `STDOUT` according to the pattern we define.

***
## Filter Contents

- To read files we can use `more` and `less` tools.
- the are fundamental pagers that allow us to scroll through the file in an interactive view.
-  `head` used to read first 10 lines and `tail`  used to read last ten lines.
-  `sort` sort file content either alphabetically or numerically.
-   

`more` :
- display text one screenful at a time.
- allow you to scroll through the text using <i> spacebar</i> . `q` for quit.
- doesnt support backward scrolling.
`less` :
- improvised feature than `more`.
- all the features of `more` and can scroll backwards. (using arrow keys).
-  search the file using `/` followed by search term.

`cut` :
- is a command for cutting out the sections from each line of files and writing the result to standard output.
- used to cut parts of a line by byte position, characters, and field.
bashCopy code

`cut OPTION... [FILE]...`

| Option               | Description                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -b, –bytes=LIST      | Selects only the bytes specified in `LIST` (e.g., `-b 1-3,7`).                                      |
| -c, –characters=LIST | Selects only the characters specified in `LIST` (e.g., `-c 1-3,7`).                                 |
| -d, –delimiter=DELIM | Uses `DELIM` as the field delimiter character instead of the tab character.                         |
| -f, –fields=LIS      | Selects only the fields specified in `LIST`, separated by the delimiter character (default is tab). |
| -n                   | Do not split multi-byte characters (no effect unless `-b` or `-c` is specified).                    |
| –complement          | Invert the selection of fields/characters. Print the fields/characters not selected.                |

`tr` : replace certain characters from a line with characters we defined.
```
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " "
```
here we replaced `:` with space.

`column` : search result can often have an unclear representation, the tool column display result in tabular form using `-t`. 

```shell-session
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " " | column -t
``````

`awk` : Awk is a scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports. The awk command programming language requires no compiling and allows the user to use variables, numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators.

for more details please look at [[awk]] 
 
`sed` : sed cmd in linux stand for stream editor and it used to perform lot of functions on file like searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion. most commonly used for substitution or for find and repalce.

For more details please look at [[sed]] 
 
`wc` : count the lines or characters.
***
## Regular Expressions

- RegEx used to search for pattern in text and files. 
- used to replace text, analyze data, validate input , perform searches and more. (in simple term used to analyze manipulate strings.)

- Regular Expression is a sequence of letters and symbols that form a search pattern.
- we use tool like `grep` and `sed` .

#### Grouping

- regex offers possibilityu to group the desired search pattern.

| **Operators** | **Description** |                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1             | `(a)`           | The round brackets are used to group parts of a regex. Within the brackets, you can define further patterns which should be processed together.                             |
| 2             | `[a-z]`         | The square brackets are used to define character classes. Inside the brackets, you can specify a list of characters to search for.                                          |
| 3             | `{1,10}`        | The curly brackets are used to define quantifiers. Inside the brackets, you can specify a number or a range that indicates how often a previous pattern should be repeated. |
| 4             | `\|`            | Also called the OR operator and shows results when one of the two expressions matches                                                                                       |
| 5             | `.*`            | Also called the AND operator and displayed results only if both expressions match                                                                                           |
- Example of or operator

```shell-session
grep -E "(my|false)" /etc/passwd

-E : extended regex.
```

-  AND operator
```shell-session
grep -E "(my.*false)" /etc/passwd
```

For more info take look at [[grep]] .

***
## Permission Management

- permission are assigned to users and groups.
-  for access contains in directory user must traverse (navigate to) the directory.
	- this require user to have execute permission on the directory. without this access user can not access directory contents and present with `permission denied` error.
	-  > [!info] It is important to note that `execute` permissions are necessary to traverse a directory, no matter the user's level of access. Also, `execute` permissions on a directory do not allow a user to execute or modify any files or contents within the directory, only to traverse and access the content of the directory. 

- different types of permissions a file or directory can be assigned:
	- (`r`) - Read
	- (`w`) - Write
	- (`x`) - Execute

- The permissions can be set for the `owner`, `group`, and `others` like presented in the next example with their corresponding permissions.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ ls -l /etc/passwd

- rwx rw- r--   1 root root 1641 May  4 23:42 /etc/passwd
- --- --- ---   |  |    |    |   |__________|
|  |   |   |    |  |    |    |        |_ Date
|  |   |   |    |  |    |    |__________ File Size
|  |   |   |    |  |    |_______________ Group
|  |   |   |    |  |____________________ User
|  |   |   |    |_______________________ Number of hard links
|  |   |   |_ Permission of others (read)
|  |   |_____ Permissions of the group (read, write)
|  |_________ Permissions of the owner (read, write, execute)
|____________ File type (- = File, d = Directory, l = Link, ... )
```

#### Change Permission

- We can modify permissions using the `chmod` command.
- permission group references (`u` - owner, `g` - Group, `o` - others, `a` - All users).
- either `a[+]`or `a [-]` to add remove the designated permissions.
- we can also use octal value assignment (prefered one).
- Let us look at all the representations associated with it to understand better how the permission assignment is calculated.

```shell-session
Binary Notation:                4 2 1  |  4 2 1  |  4 2 1
----------------------------------------------------------
Binary Representation:          1 1 1  |  1 0 1  |  1 0 0
----------------------------------------------------------
Octal Value:                      7    |    5    |    4
----------------------------------------------------------
Permission Representation:      r w x  |  r - x  |  r - -
```

#### Change Owner
- we use `chown` cmd to change owner or group  of file or directory.
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ chown <user>:<group> <file/directory>
```

#### SUID & SGID
- special permissions for files by setting the `Set User ID` (`SUID`) and `Set Group ID` (`SGID`) bits. 
- These `SUID`/`SGID` bits allow users to run programs with the rights of another user.
- The letter "`s`" is used instead of an "`x`" . `rwxrwsrwx`

#### Sticky Bit
- Sticky bits are a type of file permission in Linux that can be set on directories. 
- This type of permission provides an extra layer of security when controlling the deletion and renaming of files within a directory. 
- It is typically used on directories that are shared by multiple users to prevent one user from accidentally deleting or renaming files that are important to others.
-  it is represented by the letter “`t`" in the execute permission of the directory's permissions. `rwxrwxrwt` or `rwxrwxrwT`
	- > [!info] If the sticky bit is capitalized (`T`), then this means that all other users do not have `execute` (`x`) permissions and, therefore, cannot see the contents of the folder nor run any programs from it. The lowercase sticky bit (`t`) is the sticky bit where the `execute` (`x`) permissions have been set.
