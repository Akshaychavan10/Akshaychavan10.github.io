## Port Scanning

**Ports State**

**Open**: An open port means that there is an active service running on the target system and listening for incoming connections on that port.

**Closed**: A closed port means that there is no active service listening on that port.

**Filtered**: A filtered port means that Nmap was unable to determine whether the port is open or closed due to various reasons, such as firewall rules, packet filtering, or network congestion.


| `cmd`          | Use cases                                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nmap -F <ip>` | it scans the top 100 most common ports as determined by the Nmap developers. |
|                | scan specific ports                                                          |

## Scan Type

three main scan type :
1. TCP Connect Scans (-sT)
2. SYN "Half-open" Scans (-sS)
3. UDP Scans (-sU)

there are also less common scan type.

4. TCP Null Scans (-sN)
5. TCP FIN Scans (-sF)
6. TCP Xmas Scans (-sX)

#### 1. TCP Connect Scans

- A TCP Connect scan works by performing the three-way handshake with each target port in turn.
- Nmap sends a TCP request with the SYN flag set to a closed port, the target server will respond with a TCP packet with the RST (Reset) flag set. that how nmap figure out that port is closed.
- the request is sent to an open port, the target will respond with a TCP packet with the SYN/ACK flags set. Nmap then marks this port as being open (and completes the handshake by sending back a TCP packet with ACK set).
- Many firewalls are configured to simply drop incoming packets. Nmap sends a TCP SYN request, and receives nothing back. This indicates that the port is being protected by a firewall and thus the port is considered to be filtered.

> firewall can be configure to respond with a RST TCP packet. This can make it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to get an accurate reading of the target(s).

#### 2.**SYN "Half-open" Scans**  (syn scan/ half open scan / stealth scan)

- Where TCP connect scans perform a full three-way handshake with the target, SYN Half-open scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server
- this prevents the server from repeatedly trying to make the request

Advantages :

- bypass older IDS ( Not working with modern IDS)
- SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as standard practice is to log a connection once it's been fully established.
- faster than `tcp connect scan`
Disadvantage :
- req `sudo` privileges
- Unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans
    
> By default run with nmap if used sudo privileges.If run without sudo permissions, Nmap defaults to the TCP Connect scan

- When using a SYN scan to identify closed and filtered ports, the exact same rules as with a TCP Connect scan apply.

#### 3. UDP SCAN

- UDP connection are stateless
- so it not use handshakes.
- it sending packets to a target port and essentially hoping that they make it
- that's why UDP significantly more difficult (and much slower) to scan.
    
Open/filter : No response from target.

Open : If it gets a UDP response , then the port is marked as open.

Closed : When a packet is sent to a closed UDP port, the target should respond with an ICMP (ping) packet containing a message that the port is unreachable.

#### 4. Null, FIN, XMAS

- Less commonaly used.
- all three scan are interlinked and stealthier.

**Null Scan**: In a null scan, Nmap sends TCP packets with no flags set (hence the term "null"). This means that none of the TCP control bits (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, PSH, URG) are set in the packet header. The idea behind a null scan is to see how the target system reacts to receiving a "bare" packet. If the port is open, it will typically not respond at all, while if it's closed, the system should respond with a TCP RST packet.

Command in Nmap: `nmap -sN [target]`

**FIN Scan**: In a FIN scan, Nmap sends TCP packets with only the FIN (Finish) flag set. This scan takes advantage of the behavior of certain systems where they will not respond to a FIN packet. if the port is open target system may not respond, but if it closed ,it will respond with a RST packet.

Command in Nmap: `nmap -sF [target]`

**Xmas Scan**: In an Xmas scan, Nmap sends TCP packets with the FIN, URG, and PUSH flags set. The combination of these flags, when set together, resembles the blinking lights of a Christmas tree, hence the name "Xmas" scan. Like the FIN scan, the Xmas scan takes advantage of the behavior of certain systems to infer the state of ports.

Command in Nmap: `nmap -sX [target]`

## ICMP Network scanning

Nmap sends an ICMP packet to each possible IP address for the specified network. When it receives a response, it marks the IP address that responded as being alive.

- we use `-sn`  for ping sweep
- `-sn`  : tell nmap not to scan port , forcing it to rely on icmp echo packet ( or ARP requests on a local network, if run with sudo or directly as the root user) to identify live targets.
it also send TCP SYN packet to port 443 of the target, as well as a TCP ACK (or TCP SYN if not run as root) packet to port 80 of the target.

## NSE

- written in lua.
- used to do a variety of things: from scanning for vulnerabilities, to automating exploits for them.

**Categories**

1. safe:- Won't affect the target
2. intrusive:- Not safe: likely to affect the target
3. vuln:- Scan for vulnerabilities
4. exploit:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
5. auth:- Attempt to bypass authentication for runnservices (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
6. brute:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
7. discovery:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).

 ```shell
--script=vuln, --script=safe, --script=discovery
```

- some scripts require arguments. this can be given by `--script-args`  switch. eg : `http-put`  script take argument. url to upload file and file location on disk.

```shell
nmap -p 80 --script http-put --script-args http-put.url='/dav/shell.php',http-put.file='./shell.php'
```

- two option for search a script
1. [https://nmap.org/nsedoc/](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/)
2. `/usr/share/nmap/scripts`

`/usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db`  file :  formatted text file containing filenames and categories for each available script. eg : `ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ftp*`

**Installing new scripts** :

```
sudo wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse
nmap --script-updatedb //update script.db file
```

## Firewall evasion

The `-Pn` flag in Nmap is used to skip the host discovery phase of the scanning process.
This flag is particularly useful when you know the target(s) are likely to be blocking ping requests or other probes used by Nmap for host discovery.

`-f` :- Used to fragment the packets (i.e. split them into smaller pieces) making it less likely that the packets will be detected by a firewall or IDS.

`--scan-delay <time>ms` :- used to add a delay between packets sent. This is very useful if the network is unstable, but also for evading any time-based firewall/IDS triggers which may be in place.

`--badsum` :- this is used to generate in invalid checksum for packets. Any real TCP/IP stack would drop this packet, however, firewalls may potentially respond automatically, without bothering to check the checksum of the packet. As such, this switch can be used to determine the presence of a firewall/IDS.
