## Introduction

Cyber security jobs are growing increasingly in demand and pay well. From aggressive pentesting (hacking machines and reporting on flaws) to defensive security, the security industry offers a wide range of opportunities (defending against and investigating cyberattacks).

## Security Analyst

**Security Analysts**
Building security measures across organizations to safeguard the corporation from cyberattacks is critical.

- Analysts investigate and assess enterprise networks in order to provide engineers with meaningful data and recommendations for developing preventative measures.
- Working with a variety of stakeholders to obtain a better knowledge of security requirements and the security landscape is a requirement of this profession.

**Responsibilities**:

- Working with various stakeholders to analyse the cyber security throughout the company
Compile ongoing reports about the safety of networks, documenting security issues and measures taken in response
- Develop security plans, incorporating research on new attack tools and trends, and measures needed across teams to maintain data security.

## security Engineer

Threats and vulnerability data, which are frequently obtained from members of the security workforce, are used by security engineers to build and deploy security solutions.

- Web application attacks, network risks, and developing trends and methods are among the attacks that security engineers seek to prevent.
- The ultimate goal is to maintain and implement security measures in order to reduce the danger of an attack and data loss.

**Responsibilities**:

- Testing and screening security measures across software
- Monitor networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilities
- Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security

## Incident Responder

Security breaches are dealt with by incident responders in a productive and effective manner.

- Creating plans, rules, and protocols for organizations to implement before and after incidents is one of their responsibilities.
- This is frequently a high-pressure job, with assessments and answers needed in real time as attacks unfold.
- MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR are incident response metrics that measure how long it takes to identify, recognize, and recover from an incident (from attacks.)
- The goal is to respond quickly and effectively, maintain financial stability, and avoid negative consequences from the breach.
- In the end, incident responders defend the company’s data, reputation, and financial status from cyberattacks.

**Responsibilities**:

- Developing and adopting a thorough, actionable incident response plan
- Maintaining strong security best practices and supporting incident response measures
- Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks, considering learnings and adaptations to take from incidents

## Digital Forensics Examiner

This could be the ideal profession for you if you enjoy playing detective. If you worked for a law enforcement agency, you would be responsible for gathering and analyzing evidence in order to help solve crimes, including prosecuting the guilty and vindicating the innocent.

If your job is safeguarding a company’s network, on the other hand, you’ll be using your forensic skills to investigate situations such as policy violations.

**Responsibilities**:

- Collect digital evidence while observing legal procedures
- Analyse digital evidence to find answers related to the case
- Document your findings and report on the case

## Malware Analyst

A malware analyst’s job includes analyzing suspicious programs, figuring out what they perform, and creating reports about them.

- The fundamental task of a malware analyst, often known as a reverse engineer, is to transform executable programs from machine language to readable code, usually in a low-level language.
- This job demands the malware analyst to have a solid programming background, particularly in low-level languages like assembly and C.
- The ultimate goal is to learn about all of a harmful program’s operations, as well as how to detect and report it.

**Responsibilities**:

- Carry out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering
- Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment
- Document and report all the findings

## Penetration Tester

Pentesting and ethical hacking are terms used to describe penetration testing.

- A penetration tester’s job is to assess the security of a company’s systems and software by using systematic hacking to find flaws and vulnerabilities.
- Penetration testers take use of these vulnerabilities to assess the risk in each case.
- The organization can then use these findings to correct problems and avoid a real-world hacks.

**Responsibilities**:

- Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
- Perform security assessments, audits, and analyse policies
- Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention

## Red Teamer

Red teams are comparable to penetration testers, however, they have a more focused job responsibility.

- Red teamers are used to test the company’s detection and response capabilities, while penetration testers hunt for multiple weaknesses across systems to keep cyber-defence in good standing.
- This job entails mimicking cyber criminals’ actions, simulating malicious attacks, maintaining access, and avoiding discovery.
- Red team assessments can last up to a month and are usually conducted by a team from outside the organization.
- They are frequently best suited to organizations with well-developed security processes.

**Responsibilities**:

- Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection
- Assess organisations’ security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures
- Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances
