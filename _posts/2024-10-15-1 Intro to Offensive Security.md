**What is Offensive Security:** 

Offensive security involves breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes to gain unauthorized access. 

To counter hackers effectively, one needs to adopt a similar mindset, identifying vulnerabilities and recommending patches before they're exploited. Defensive security, on the other hand, focuses on protecting networks and systems from digital threats.

**How Can I Start Learning:** 

Starting with cybersecurity involves breaking down the field into manageable parts, focusing on areas of interest, and practicing regularly.
